            <th> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:25px> Bradley is the master-mind and creator of this application! 
                <br> He was brought up hunting-orientated family in Queenstown, New Zealand which provided a lot of hunting opportunities of mainly deer, but also goats, rabbits and the odd Tahr. He was often shooting from long distances but found many apps were limited in their capacity or too complicated for most hunters. 
                <br> So, he decided to create Ballistics Buddy because he wanted a more user-friendly app that included additional features to increase accuracy. </p>    </th>
