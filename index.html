		<h1>Ballsitics Buddy</h1>
		<p style=LINE-HEIGHT:25px>Ballistics Buddy is an application designed to calculate the scope's Elevation and Windage adjustments for long range shooting.
		It works by calculating the bullet trajectory relative to the scope's line of sight, where the trajectory is influenced by gravity, the aerodynamic drag, the wind, your specific rifle setup, air density (temperature, pressure/altitude, and humidity), Gyroscopic spin drift, and the Coriolis force.
		The aim of this application is to be quick and easy to use in the field, while still being able to capture all of the significant factors which influence the bullet's trajectory. <p>
